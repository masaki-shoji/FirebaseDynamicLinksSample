# FirebaseDynamicLinksSample
**A sample app, which is a demonstration of Firebase Dynamic Links.**

This project does not include "google-services.json" and the keystore file for security.

However, it is possible to clone the code and add your own necessary files above, so that you can debug the project by yourself.

**And, you can install this demo app on Goole Play Store.**

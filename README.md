# FirebaseDynamicLinksSample
A sample app, which is a demonstration of Firebase Dynamic Links.

This project does not include "google-services.json" and the keystore file for security.

However, it is possible to clone the code and add your own necessary files above, so that you can debug the project by yourself.
